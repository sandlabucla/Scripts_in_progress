# Scripts in progress

These scripts are currently being created by SAND Lab RAs, once they are 
completed and checked, they will be added to the main Scripts folder and deleted from here. Yael Waizman (lab manager) will be assisting RAs to create these scripts\

The current focus of these scripts are to create questionnaire scoring 
functions for self-report survey instruments that are widely utilized 
across studies in the lab.
